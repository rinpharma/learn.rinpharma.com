Like our\nconference, we hope for this page to provide free, world-class education\nwhere you can learn by doing and build confidence in practical R in\nPharma skills. We will try to provide live environments where you can\nplay with the code/analysis to help professionals develop the skills\nneeded for the top priorities in the drug development space.\nOur articles will help gain new knowledge and skills in a variety of\nways, from engaging video lectures, write-ups and hands-on cloud\nenvironments with live code with no installation required\nOur soon to be created labs will include challenges with step-by-step\ninstructions and access to pre-configured cloud environments. This will\ngive you an efficient way to practice what you are learning and expand\nknowledge beyond just reading. Keep an eye out for this in\n2023/2024.\nCommunity Adoption\nHow hope is that this effort will help expand the communities\ncurriculum through rinpharma blended learning efforts. We hope this will\nprovide pharmas with access to high-quality, domain-specific training\nmaterials and further micro-courses can be built with this material.\nThe\nfollowing tools are used in our learning efforts:\nRStudio Cloud:\nRStudio Cloud is a cRStudio Cloud is a lightweight,\ncloud-based solution that allows anyone to do, share, teach and learn\ndata science online\nRmarkdown:\nRmarkdown is a package for R that combines\nsimple markdown authoring tools for formatting text with\nchunks of R code; when compiled using knitr the resulting\noutput is a formatted document that contains the results of executing\nthe embedded R code. Although Rmarkdown can\nproduce files in a variety of formats, the two of particular interest in\nthis project are html and pdf formats.\nR Packages: One of the strengths of R is\nthe availability of packages of R functions that are\ndesigned to work with data. The materials in this project, for example,\nuse the Distill\npackage to create our online learnings.\n\n\n\n",
