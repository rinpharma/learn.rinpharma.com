Like our conference, we hope for this page to provide free, world-class education where you can learn by doing and build confidence in practical R in Pharma skills. We will try to provide live environments where you can play with the code/analysis to help professionals develop the skills needed for the top priorities in the drug development space.\nOur articles will help gain new knowledge and skills in a variety of ways, from engaging video lectures, write-ups and hands-on cloud environments with live code with no installation required\nOur soon to be created labs will include challenges with step-by-step instructions and access to pre-configured cloud environments. This will give you an efficient way to practice what you are learning and expand knowledge beyond just reading. Keep an eye out for this in 2023/2024.\nCommunity Adoption\nHow hope is that this effort will help expand the communities curriculum through rinpharma blended learning efforts. We hope this will provide pharmas with access to high-quality, domain-specific training materials and further micro-courses can be built with this material.\nThe following tools are used in our learning efforts:\nRStudio Cloud: RStudio Cloud is a cRStudio Cloud is a lightweight, cloud-based solution that allows anyone to do, share, teach and learn data science online\nRmarkdown: Rmarkdown is a package for R that combines simple markdown authoring tools for formatting text with chunks of R code; when compiled using knitr the resulting output is a formatted document that contains the results of executing the embedded R code. Although Rmarkdown can produce files in a variety of formats, the two of particular interest in this project are html and pdf formats.\nR Packages: One of the strengths of R is the availability of packages of R functions that are designed to work with data. The materials in this project, for example, use the Distill package to create our online learnings.\n\n\n\n",

Our group also helps train R admins via our training course held quarterly (planned). The trainings help provide admins with virtual machines they can use to exploring R, packages and RStudio. The course will provide insights into identifying and fixing errors and best practices. In the course, you will set up a sandbox environment and learn how to use RStudio Team through practical exercises. We provide you with a virtual environment in the cloud that you can connect to via SSH and browser.\nOne idea is having an Pharma R Admin certification available to those that complete the course (under development).\nKeep an eye out for our workshops, panels and talks at R in Pharma 2022!\nMeeting notes\nThur 12th of May 22.\nTopic: RinPharma: Pharma R Admin Task Force\nDate: May 12, 2022 12:01 PM Indiana (East)\nMeeting Recording:\nhttps://rstudio.zoom.us/rec/share/DcyUkx6Vkgkq9cwDeq2XY4k8M7odXkxngIUnIQsWkkfqqCr42vrcBOElTJNUptfo.j7SO3xzbtfmxfeOa\nAccess Passcode: rinpharma_radmin_051222\nNotes\nWE decided on this being a quarterly meeting.\n\n\n\n",
