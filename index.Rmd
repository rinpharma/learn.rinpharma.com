This website is a collection of efforts and *learning paths* for people interested in R in Pharma. R in Pharma has been hosting workshops and learning sessions since its first conference at Harvard University in 2018. Here you can find the videos and resources. R in Pharma collaborates with many people in the pharma and life sciences space to gather these resources and we are thankful for their efforts!

Starting in 2022, R in Pharma is focusing more on its learning efforts and bring content here to learn.rinpharma.com!

Feel free to reach out if you have ideas for webinars, have questions about GxP reporting, need help for an internal event or interested in our Task Forces.
