Shiny has always been a big part of RinPharma. Joe Cheng did a Keynote in 2018 (https://rinpharma.com/publication/rinpharma_33/), helped create Shinymeta in 2019, we held the popular "Unleash Shiny" in 2020 that sold out in hours and we held multiple workshops & talks on Shiny in 2021!

In 2020 we announced our future efforts around Shiny at the RStudio conference:
